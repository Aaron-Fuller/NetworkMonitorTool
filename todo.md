## Configuration Parameters

- **Task**: Extract hardcoded values like the threshold for high latency or the number of pings for packet loss checking into a configuration section or file.
- **Benefit**: Easier adjustments without modifying the main logic of the script.

## Expand Logging

- **Task**: Improve the logging mechanism to include more diagnostic information, such as average latency for every check.
- **Benefit**: Provide a more comprehensive view of the network's status over time.

## Enhance Error Handling

- **Task**: Implement specific exception handling for different types of errors.
- **Benefit**: More graceful error management and user-friendly error messages.

## Modularize Functions

- **Task**: Break down larger functions for better modularity and code reuse.
- **Benefit**: Improved code readability and maintainability.

## External Services

- **Task**: Add the ability to check against multiple domains or services, not just `www.google.com`.
- **Benefit**: Ensure issues aren't localized to one domain.

## Notification System

- **Task**: Implement a notification system to alert administrators via email, SMS, or other means when network issues persist.
- **Benefit**: Proactive response to persistent network issues.

## Performance Optimizations

- **Task**: Evaluate and optimize the script for performance, especially if running frequently or on systems with limited resources.
- **Benefit**: Reduced system overhead and faster execution.

## Interactive Mode

- **Task**: Add an interactive mode where users can manually trigger specific checks or adjust settings on-the-fly.
- **Benefit**: Flexibility in diagnosing issues in real-time.

## History Analysis

- **Task**: Implement a mechanism to analyze the log history for recurring problems.
- **Benefit**: Gain insights into patterns and recurring network issues.

## Integration with Monitoring Tools

- **Task**: Integrate the script with existing network monitoring platforms or tools.
- **Benefit**: A consolidated view of the network's health.

## Support for Different Environments

- **Task**: Develop versions or modules of the script for different platforms or environments beyond Windows.
- **Benefit**: Extend the utility of the script to diverse systems.

## Documentation

- **Task**: Enhance the script's documentation, detailing the purpose, usage, expected inputs/outputs, and dependencies.
- **Benefit**: Easier onboarding for new users or developers.
